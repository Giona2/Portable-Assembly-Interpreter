# Portable Assembly Interpreter
The Portable Assembly Interpreter (`pai`) is arguably the most important part of the portable assembly toolchain. This tool is what's responsible for running Portable Binary (`.pbin`) files and making them work on a wide variety of computers (at least, in the future).  
  
These docs are meant to explain how `pai` works at a fundamental level. If you would like to expermiment with Portable Assembly, check out the Portable Assembly Compiler Collection docs to learn about the languages built upon by Portable Assembly
